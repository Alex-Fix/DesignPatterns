# Facade

> The facade pattern (also spelled façade) is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.

## Use cases

* When there is a complex system, and it is necessary to simplify work with it. The facade will allow you to define one point of interaction between the client and the system
* When it is necessary to reduce the number of dependencies between the client and a complex system. Facade objects allow you to separate, isolate the components of the system from the client and develop and work with them independently
* When you need to define subsystems of components in a complex system. Creating facades for the components of each individual subsystem will simplify the interaction between them and increase their independence from each other.
