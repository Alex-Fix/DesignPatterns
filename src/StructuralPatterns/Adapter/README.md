# Adapter

> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

## Use cases

* When you need to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't fit your needs
* When you need to use an already existing class in conjunction with other classes whose interfaces are not compatible
