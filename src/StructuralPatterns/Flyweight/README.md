# Flyweight

> In computer programming, the flyweight software design pattern refers to an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing some of its data with other similar objects. The flyweight pattern is one of twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns. These patterns promote flexible object-oriented software design, which is easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

## Use cases

* When an application uses a large number of repetitive objects, which causes a large amount of memory allocation
* When a part of the state of an object that is mutable can be moved outside. Removing external state allows you to replace many objects with a small group of common shared objects
