# Bridge

> The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four. The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.
## Use cases

* When to avoid constant binding of abstraction to implementation
* When, along with the implementation, it is necessary to change the abstraction independently of each other. That is, a change in the abstraction should not lead to a change in the implementation
