# Composite

> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Use cases

* When objects should be implemented as a hierarchical tree structure
* When clients have to manage both entire objects and their component parts in a uniform way. That is, the whole and its parts must implement the same interface
