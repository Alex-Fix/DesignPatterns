# Builder

> The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is one of the Gang of Four design patterns.

## Use cases

* When the process of creating a new object should not depend on what parts this object consists of and how these parts are interconnected
* When it is necessary to ensure that various variations of an object are obtained during its creation
