# Visitor

> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

## Use cases

* When there are many objects of heterogeneous classes with different interfaces, and it is required to perform a series of operations on each of these objects
* When classes need to add the same set of operations without changing these classes
* When new operations are often added to classes, while the overall structure of the classes is stable and practically does not change
