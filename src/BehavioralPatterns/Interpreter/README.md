# Interpreter

> In computer programming, the interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized computer language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence for a client.

## Use cases

* Specialized database query languages such as SQL
* Specialized computer languages that are often used to describe communication protocols
* Most general-purpose computer languages actually incorporate several specialized languages
