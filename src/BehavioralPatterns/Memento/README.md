# Memento

> The memento pattern is a software design pattern that exposes the private internal state of an object. One example of how this can be used is to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback), another is versioning, another is custom serialization.

## Use cases

* When you need to save the state of an object for possible later recovery
* When state saving should take place without violating the principle of encapsulation
