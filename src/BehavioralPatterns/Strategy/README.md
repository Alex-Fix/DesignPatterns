# Strategy

> In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

## Use cases

* When there are multiple related classes that differ in behavior. You can set one main class, and put different behaviors into separate classes and apply them if necessary
* When it is necessary to provide a choice of several options for algorithms that can be easily changed depending on conditions
* When it is necessary to change the behavior of objects at the stage of program execution
* When a class that uses a certain functionality does not need to know anything about its implementation
