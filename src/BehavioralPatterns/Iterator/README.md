# Iterator

> In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

## Use cases

* When it is necessary to bypass an object without revealing its internal structure
* When there is a set of composite objects, and it is necessary to provide a single interface for iterating over them
* When it is necessary to provide several alternative iterations of the same object
