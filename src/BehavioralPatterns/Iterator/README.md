# State

> The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines. The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.

## Use cases

* When an object's behavior should depend on its state and can change dynamically at runtime
* When multiple conditional constructs are used in the code of object methods, the choice of which depends on the current state of the object
